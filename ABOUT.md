# About Hush Relay

**Hush Relay** is an open-source, end-to-end encrypted messenger with voice and video calls, built to run on a relay you own. There are no accounts, no phone numbers and no app store, and nobody in the middle can read what you send.

## Purpose

Most messengers depend on one company's servers and its rules. Hush Relay makes it practical for anyone to run their own small, private relay (on a VPS, a spare phone or basic hosting), invite only the people they choose, and inspect every line of code involved. Encryption happens on each person's device; the relay only ever stores and forwards sealed envelopes.

## Components

| Component | Implementation | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| App | HTML, vanilla JavaScript, WebCrypto, WebCodecs, service worker | Keys, encryption, contacts, calls; installable as a web app (PWA) |
| Android app | Java WebView shell, no libraries (`android/`) | The same app bundled in a small APK, with screenshot blocking and no cloud backup |
| Go relay | One binary, Go standard library only (`cmd/hush-relay`) | Mailboxes, live delivery, call rooms over WebSocket, private path, invite-only mode; serves the app |
| PHP relay | One file (`web/relay.php`) | Messages on ordinary shared hosting (no calls) |
| Protocol | [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md) | Double Ratchet, sealed envelopes, calls, recovery, device moves |
| Tests | Go, Node.js, shell, Playwright, Android emulator | Crypto and relay checks, hardening, five-browser and on-device runs including video calls |

## What it does not promise

**Experimental, with no independent professional cryptographic audit.** It has been through several rounds of internal adversarial review (see the [audit log](SECURITY.md#audit-log)), but passing tests and internal reviews are not proof of production-grade security. Don't rely on it where a failure could put people in danger; use [Signal](https://signal.org) or [SimpleX](https://simplex.chat) for that.

The relay can see metadata: IP addresses, which mailbox receives mail, timing, approximate (padded) sizes, and that a call happened and for how long. Whoever serves the web app could change its code, so pinning and reviewing the deployed client matters; the Android app bundles a fixed copy. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

Current limits: one active device per profile, no push notifications, one-to-one calls, and message history kept only on the device that received it.

## Getting started

- **Use it:** open an invite link from someone who runs a relay, or install the Android app from [Releases](https://github.com/altrudev/Hush-Relay/releases).
- **Host it:** download the relay for your device from Releases and follow the [self-hosting guide](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md).
- **Try it locally:** `go build -o hush-relay ./cmd/hush-relay && ./hush-relay`, then open http://localhost:8080 in two browsers.

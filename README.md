# Hush Relay

**A small, self-hostable, end-to-end encrypted messenger with voice and video calls. No accounts, no phone numbers, no app store.**

Hush Relay is two pieces:

- **The app** is a web page (a PWA) made of plain HTML and JavaScript. You open it in a browser and can install it to your home screen, or install the **Android app**, which bundles the same code. All encryption happens there.
- **The relay** is a dumb mailbox. It stores encrypted envelopes until the recipient picks them up, and it can't read them or see who sent them. It comes in two interchangeable versions: a **single Go binary** with the app built in (standard library only, no dependencies) and **one PHP file** for shared hosting.

You run the relay yourself, on a spare Android phone, a $5 VPS, a Raspberry Pi or ordinary shared hosting. With a **private path and a join code** it looks like an ordinary website to everyone except the people you invite, and messages and calls travel as normal HTTPS traffic to your own server. A **Tor onion service** is optional, never required. You can also publish the app on IPFS.

> ⚠️ **Status: experimental and not independently audited.** The design uses standard building blocks (a Signal-style Double Ratchet on WebCrypto), but it has only had two rounds of internal adversarial review ([audit log](SECURITY.md#audit-log)), not one by outside cryptographers. Use it for everyday privacy, learning and experiments. **If your safety depends on your messages** (activists, journalists, sources, people facing a hostile government), use [Signal](https://signal.org) or [SimpleX](https://simplex.chat) instead. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Features

- **End-to-end encryption with forward secrecy:** a Double Ratchet, so a stolen device can't decrypt messages captured earlier.
- **A sealed sender:** the relay can't tell who sent a message. Messages are padded to fixed sizes, so the relay learns only a coarse length.
- **Voice and video calls:** encrypted end to end with a fresh key per call, carried over your relay's HTTPS connection. No peer-to-peer link, so neither side sees the other's IP address.
- **Private relay:** a hidden path with a plain front page, and invite-only mode so strangers can't use your server. Invite links carry the join code, so friends just tap and start.
- **Android app:** a small APK (no app store, no Google services) built with the plain SDK tools; it blocks screenshots and keeps keys out of cloud backups.
- **Live delivery:** messages arrive in under a second while the app is open, and wait up to 14 days on the relay while you're offline.
- **No sign-up:** your identity is a key generated on your device. You add contacts by QR code or invite link.
- **Safety numbers** to check that nobody is in the middle. Strangers who message you arrive as *requests* until you reply.
- **Move your account by QR:** scan a one-time code from your old device and approve after matching a 12-digit code.
- **6 recovery words:** an encrypted backup kept on your relay, so you can get your account back on any device. The relay can't open it.
- **Different relays talk to each other:** each person can use a different relay, in any country.
- **No dependencies:** vanilla JS, WebCrypto and WebCodecs in the browser; a Go relay built only on the standard library (or one PHP file); a Java Android shell with no libraries. Three small vendored libraries handle QR codes and the wordlist.

## Quick start (local, 1 minute)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/altrudev/Hush-Relay.git hush-relay
cd hush-relay
go build -o hush-relay ./cmd/hush-relay && ./hush-relay     # Go 1.22+
# or, with PHP 7.4+:  ./scripts/serve.sh
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in two different browsers (or one normal and one private window). Create a profile in one, tap **Invite someone** and open that link in the other. Then chat, or start a call from the chat header.

## Put it on the internet

Browsers only allow the app's encryption on `https://` (or `localhost`), so a public relay needs HTTPS. Pick one:

| Where | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Your own VPS, private** (recommended) | Medium | Hidden path + join code: looks like a plain website, calls included. [Guide](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md#private-setup-recommended) |
| **Tor onion service** (optional, any Linux device or phone) | Medium | No domain, tunnel company or open ports; the location stays hidden. [Guide](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md#tor-onion-service) |
| **Spare Android phone** (Termux + Cloudflare Tunnel) | Medium | Free and always on while plugged in. [Guide](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md#android-phone-as-the-relay) |
| **VPS** (Debian/Ubuntu + Caddy) | Medium | Most reliable, about $5/month. [Guide](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md#vps) |
| **Shared hosting** (cPanel, Apache, PHP) | Easy | Upload the `web/` folder. [Guide](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md#shared-hosting) |
| **App on IPFS**, relay anywhere above | Advanced | Anyone can mirror the app. [Guide](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md#ipfs) |

The relay address gets baked into every invite, so **keep it stable.** A tunnel URL that changes on every restart will break your contacts' links.

## Using it

1. **Create a profile.** Pick a display name. Opened from an invite link, everything else is filled in.
2. **Invite someone.** Tap **Invite someone** and share the link (any messenger, email or SMS) or let them scan the QR. They open it, pick a name, and you're connected.
3. **Verify once.** Tap the yellow bar in the chat and compare the safety code in person or on a call, then tap **They match**.
4. **Call.** The phone and camera buttons in the chat header start an encrypted voice or video call.
5. **Turn on recovery words** in **Settings** and write the 6 words down. They're the only thing you need to get your profile back.
6. **New phone?** On it, choose **From my other device**. On the old one, tap **Scan**, check the 12-digit code matches and approve. The profile moves over, and the old device signs out.

On Android you can also install the [app](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md#android-app); paste an invite link on its welcome screen, or share the link to it.

## Tests

```bash
./tests/run.sh --go     # Go relay: gofmt, vet, unit tests (race-safe), then the shared suite (needs go + node 20+)
./tests/run.sh          # PHP relay (needs php + node 20+)
# add --e2e for five real browsers incl. an encrypted video call (pip install playwright && playwright install chromium)
SERIAL=emulator-5554 ./tests/android/run.sh   # Android app on an emulator (needs the Android SDK)
```

## Limits

- **Calls are one-to-one** and go through the caller's relay, which sees that a call happened, how long it lasted and roughly how much data it used, but not what was said or shown.
- **One active device per account.** Linking moves an account; it doesn't add a second device.
- **Message history stays on the device that received it.**
- **The relay operator sees metadata:** IP addresses, timing, size bucket and which mailbox gets mail. They can't see content or senders.
- **The web delivery problem:** whoever serves the app's files could serve modified code. Pin an IPFS CID or self-host the app if that matters to you.
- **No push notifications** (web or Android). Messages and calls arrive while the app is open.

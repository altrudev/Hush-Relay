# Contributing to Hush Relay

Contributions to documentation, tests, interoperability and security hardening are welcome.

## Before opening a pull request

1. Review the project [scope and limitations](ABOUT.md) and [security policy](SECURITY.md).
2. Keep changes focused and describe the threat model, behavior or bug being addressed.
3. Keep the zero-dependency design: vanilla JavaScript and WebCrypto in the app, the Go standard library in the relay, plain Java in the Android shell, no build step for the web app.
4. Run `./tests/run.sh --go` (Go 1.22+, Node.js 20+, curl) and `./tests/run.sh` (PHP relay). For UI or call changes, add `--e2e` (Python Playwright and Chromium). For Android changes, run `SERIAL=<device> ./tests/android/run.sh` on an emulator (Android SDK, JDK 17+).
5. Include tests for regressions, malformed inputs, network failure and replay or authentication failure paths where relevant.
6. Do not add analytics, tracking or telemetry by default. Avoid committing credentials, recovery words, private keys or relay mailbox data.
7. Explain new dependencies and include their upstream license and attribution notices.

## Vulnerability reporting

Do **not** post exploit details or sensitive vulnerabilities in public issues or pull requests. Use GitHub's **Report a vulnerability** feature under the repository Security tab. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for scope and reporting details.

## Licensing submissions

By submitting a contribution, you agree to make your contribution available under the existing project license, **AGPL-3.0-or-later**, and confirm that you are authorized to submit it. This does not assign your copyright to the project owner. Third-party contributions must be compatible with the project license and must retain required notices.

If you add a substantial file of your own, you may add a line with your name below it. Please don't change existing copyright lines, the [NOTICE](NOTICE) file or the logo; forks that ship modified builds should use their own name and icon (see the [brand guide](assets/brand/README.md)).

## Maintainer review

A passing automated test suite alone does not establish cryptographic security. Changes to encryption, identity, relay authorization, recovery or device linking require adversarial review and careful interoperability testing before release.
